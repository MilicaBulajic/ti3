Directions and Bagua areas marked on Floor Plan

this maps out the energy in every area of the house and representing the eight directional areas of the house.

Flying Star Worksheet
this is an astrological chart which uses time, space and objects to analyse positive and negative areas of the house and to heal/balance the energy. This includes analysing health, wealth, relationships, etc. of inhabitants.
Please note that for the full effect of Feng Shui, a yearly update for the remedies needs to be done, since every calendar year the energy of
the house changes.
Intentional Bagua Map
in this section we map out the 9 zones of your house each one of which represents a particular area of your life (health, wealth, relationships, etc.), to intentionally align the energy of the space with the life you want to live.
Final report breakdown for remedies
this is the report determining remedies derived from what is calculated in the Flying stars worksheet, which suggest the elements to use and ways how to balance the energy in every area of the house
Personal Trigram
this is based on your date of birth and gender and it is used to show your compatibility with building space, e.g. your most supportive directions for sleeping, working, etc; for all residents of your home (to a max. of 6 people)
