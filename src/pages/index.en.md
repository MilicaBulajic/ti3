      The persimmon tree became "the tree of peace"
      because after Nagasaki destruction in august 1945,
      survived only some persimmon trees.

# Feng Shui Your Home
<br>

The most important question you can ask yourself is who am I and why am I here? What is the true purpose of life? Do I live my true calling or is my life a routine? Do I live with ease and go with a flow? Do I want better relationships? Better health? Carrier luck or more financial flow?
If you feel that you don’t have control over your life, if you stopped on any of those questions, maybe is now the time to change? To start loving life and live your dreams? To live in prosperity and abundance?

Being here it means that you are already halfway to live your balanced and abundant life!
Feng Shui is an ancient Chinese art (based on directions, formulas, time, space) which we use in our modern time and modern home design to help us create the life we desire. When we heal the energy in us and around us, we transform our life.

We enhance the good energy of the space which will positively influence your life and bring good fortune. We also heal/balance the negative energy of the space which blocks us and create obstacles in our life. Each area of the house is connected with one of the areas of your life. The balance of the energy in your house will eventually reflect in your life.

When you intentionally align your living place with a good energy flow, it will support you and help you improve your life. You can know once again, that all things are possible! We are happy to help you achieve all this!
