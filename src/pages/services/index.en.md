        this is an astrological chart which uses time, space and objects to analyse positive and negative areas of the house and to heal/balance the energy. This includes analysing health, wealth, relationships, etc. of inhabitants. Please note that for the full effect of Feng Shui, a yearly update for the remedies needs to be done, since every calendar year the energy of the house changes.
